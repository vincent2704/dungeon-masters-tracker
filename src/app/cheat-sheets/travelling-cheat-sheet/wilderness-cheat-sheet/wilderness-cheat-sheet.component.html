    <td>
      Creature exposed to the cold must succeed
      on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each
      hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with
      resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically
      succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing
      cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and
      creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Extreme Heat - ≥ {{getExtremeHeatTemperature()}}</td>
    <td>
      Creature exposed to the heat and
      without access to drinkable water must succeed on
      a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
      or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the
      first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
      Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are
      clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving
      throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire
      damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as
      do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

    <td>Strong wind</td>

      Disadvantage on ranged weapon
      attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
      hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames,
      disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means
      nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind
      must land at the end of its turn or fall.
      A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that
      imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
      that rely on sight.

    <td>Heavy Precipitation</td>

      Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
      snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area
      have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
      rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames
      and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
      checks that rely on hearing.

  <tr>
    <td>High Altitude</td>
    <td>
      Traveling at altitudes of {{getHighAltitudeThreshold()}} or higher above
      sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe,
      because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the
      air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at
      high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of
      determining how long that creature can travel.
      Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high
      altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.
      Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to
      elevations above {{getVeryHighAltitudeThreshold()}} unless they are native to
      such environments.

  <tr>
    <td>Desecrated Ground</td>
    <td>
      Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the
      unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated
      ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell
      cast within range reveals its presence.
      Undead standing on desecrated ground have
      advantage on all saving throws.
      A vial of holy water purifies a {{getHolyWaterPurifyArea()}} area of
      desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow
      spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

    <td>Frigid Water</td>
    <td>
      A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a
      number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before
      suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent
      in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a
      DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of
      exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to
      cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw,
      as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in
      ice-cold water.

  <tr>
    <td>Quicksand</td>
    <td>
      A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a {{getQuicksandArea()}} area
      and is usually {{getQuicksandDepth()}} deep. When a creature enters the area,
      <!--      TODO: add showing restrained rules on 'restrained' click-->
      it sinks {{getQuicksandSinkingModifier()}} into the quicksand and becomes restrained.
      At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks
      another {{getQuicksandSinkingConstant()}}. As long as the creature isn't completely
      submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and
      succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is {{getQuicksandDifficultyCheck(10)}}
      the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature
      that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe
<!--      TODO: add showing suffocation rules on 'suffocation' click-->
      (see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook).
      A creature can pull another creature within its reach
      out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding
      on a Strength check. The DC is {{getQuicksandDifficultyCheck(5)}}
      the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

    <td>Razorvine</td>
    <td>
      Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and
      hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and
      other surfaces as ivy does. A {{getRazorvineDimensions()}}
      wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25
      hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and
      psychic damage.
      When a creature comes into direct contact with
      razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature
      must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or
      take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's
      bladelike thorns.

  <tr>
    <td>Slippery Ice</td>
    <td>
      Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves
      onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must
      succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or
      fall prone.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Thin Ice</td>
    <td>
      Thin ice has a weight tolerance of {{getThinIceWeightTolerance()}}.
      Whenever the total weight on an
      area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area
      breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through.
