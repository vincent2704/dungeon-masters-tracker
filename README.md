# Dungeon Master's Tracker

Current project [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version: 13.2.4.

## About the project

### Live demo

Demo is always automatically updated via GitHub Actions to stay up to date with master branch. The data however
is not persisted as persisting data will be managed by separate backend repository later in the future.
**Demo is available under [this address](https://vincent2704.github.io/dungeon-masters-tracker)**.

This is a Dungeons & Dragons 5e tool, which's purpose is to be kind of a **digital, interactive Dungeon Master's screen**. 
It is **NOT a graphical interface** containing info about every skill in the game, simulate rolls etc. - 
you've got other tools for that. It assumes that **the game action is on the table**, and handles repetitive tasks 
that otherwise would slow down the pace of the gameplay, so everyone can focus on the 
game itself instead of counting initiative order etc. 

## Tracked issues

Highest priority stuff is listed and tracked [here](https://github.com/users/vincent2704/projects/3/views/1).

## Known issues not listed in the project board
* no validation on inputs
* no persistence - this will be added as a separate backend repository when the frontend 
functionalities are finished
